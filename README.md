# Employee Attrition Analysis

Dataset: [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)

A short data exploration into the fictional HR data of IBM and a few simple classifiers. I aim to identify predictive features of employee attrition (i.e. an employee leaving the company) via a collection of descriminative machine learning models. Writeup is in report.pdf.

Much of the code for this is adapted from [zchuning/BankruptcyDataAnalysis](https://github.com/zchuning/BankruptcyDataAnalysis), which I also worked on.
